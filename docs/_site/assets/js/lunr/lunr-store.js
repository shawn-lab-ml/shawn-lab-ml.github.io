        "excerpt":" Overview   Put in laymanâ€™s terms, contrastive representation learning represents the models that learn a similarity measure between samples. Hence, if 2 samples are considered similar (e.g. 2 images of a cat), we would like them to be close to each other in the representation space, however we would also want this distance to be superior for samples that have nothing to do with each other (e.g. a cat and car).
